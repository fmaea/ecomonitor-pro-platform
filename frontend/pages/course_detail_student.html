    JS in app.js (or a dedicated student_course_view.js) will:
    1. Parse course ID from the URL hash (e.g., #course-detail/:id).
    2. Fetch course details from GET /courses/my-courses/:id. This should include chapters.
    3. Populate #course-title and #course-description.
    4. Render chapters into #course-chapters-list. Each chapter might have its own content view.
    5. Fetch assignments for this course from GET /courses/:id/assignments.
    6. Render assignments into #course-assignments-list. Each assignment should link to a submission page/form.
