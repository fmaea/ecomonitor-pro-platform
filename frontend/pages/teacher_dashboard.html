    JS in app.js (or a dedicated teacher.js) will:
    1. Fetch taught courses from GET /courses/teaching (via api.js and auth.js for token).
    2. For each course, potentially use a course_card_teacher.html template (or build HTML dynamically).
    3. Render the list into #teacher-courses-list.
    4. Each course card should link to #manage-course/:id.
