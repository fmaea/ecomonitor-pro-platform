    JS in app.js (or a dedicated student.js) will:
    1. Fetch enrolled courses from GET /courses/my-courses (via api.js and auth.js for token).
    2. For each course, potentially use a course_card_student.html template (or build HTML dynamically).
    3. Render the list into #student-courses-list.
    4. Each course card should link to #course-detail/:id.
